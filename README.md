I have created my ipynb project file on Google Colab, data.csv file needs to be uploaded and code can be run section wise sequentially.
I have done analysis for Power Consumption KPI's, Fuel Efficiency KPI's, Average Power Consumption Against Sea Temperature, average power consumption against true wind speed and some additional metrics.
It is been documented in ipynb file itself.
